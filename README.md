# Alien Symbol Generator
The generator creates a set of abstract symbols with various degrees of symmetry. Many different degrees of symmetry (and some less symmetrical) are included, and are picked at random. The generator uses simple cellular automata (using the Moore neighborhood) for creating an unshaded, black and white version. Additional cellular automata can create a shaded appearance for the symbols. The probabilities for which symmetry will be used, and other parameters of the cellular automata can be easily changed.

Example unshaded symbols:

# Notes on Installation

You will need to add the core.jar as an external library to the project. This jar file is provided within the zip file of Processing (processing.org), and is merely included here for convenience.
