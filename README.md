# Generator
The generator creates a set of abstract symbols with various degrees of symmetry. Many different degrees of symmetry (and some less symmetrical) are included, and are picked at random. The generator uses simple cellular automata (using the Moore neighborhood) for creating an unshaded, black and white version. Additional cellular automata can create a shaded appearance for the symbols.

Example unshaded symbols:
